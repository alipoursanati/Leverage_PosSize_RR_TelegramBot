Telegram Bot for Calculating leverage, position size and RR based on user inputs


This Python function calculates position size, leverage, and risk/reward ratio (RR) based on user inputs of entry, stop loss, targets, and wallet size. It first calculates the risk per trade by subtracting the stop loss from the entry price. The position size is then calculated by multiplying the wallet size by 0.01 and dividing by the risk. Leverage is calculated by dividing the position size by the wallet size. The script also calculates the reward based on the first target in the targets list and compares the risk/reward ratio to 1.5; returning an error message if the ratio is less than 1.5. It prompts the user to enter risk percentage, which is then converted to decimal and used in calculations. It is a basic example and the risk management strategy and calculation may vary depending on individual trader's preference.

It's worth noting that this script is a basic example and that the risk management strategy and calculation may vary depending on the individual trader's preference.


Instructions:

First, you will need to create a new bot on Telegram. You can do this by talking to the "BotFather" on Telegram. Type "@BotFather" in the search bar and start a chat with him. He will give you instructions on how to create a new bot.

Once you have your bot's token, you will need to install the python-telegram-bot library. You can do this by opening the terminal on your computer and typing the following command: pip install python-telegram-bot

Next, open a text editor, like Notepad or Sublime, and copy and paste the code. Make sure to replace "TOKEN" with your bot's token.

Save the file with a name, let's say script.py

Open the terminal again and navigate to the folder where you saved the script.py file and type in python script.py

Your bot should now be running and you can test it by talking to it on Telegram.

Once you have tested your bot and made sure that it's working as expected, you can share it with others by giving them the script.py file. They will need to have Python installed on their computer and they will need to repeat steps 2 through 6 to run the bot.

Note that you will need to keep your computer running, and running the script, for the bot to be online and responsive to users.

And that's it! Now you have your own Telegram bot that you can share with others.
